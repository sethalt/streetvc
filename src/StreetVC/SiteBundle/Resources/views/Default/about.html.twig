      <p>Investable, LLC is a marketplace lending platform connecting borrowers in need of capital between $10,000 and $200,000 with lenders interested in generating a competitive interest rate of return. Lenders (“investors”) have an opportunity to lend capital to borrowers in need of money at a mutually agreed upon interest rate. Loans are paid out bi-weekly or monthly throughout the term of the loan, which is customized for borrower-specific needs.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1em;">Our company collects information beyond the business-specific information and aims to incorporate data points from social media and other online business operations to develop a comprehensive assessment of each and every applicant. 
Our team uses a proprietary credit-scoring algorithm which looks at borrower-specific performance to generate a credit risk assessment within minutes.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 1em;">Lenders have an opportunity to browse through borrower requests, watching personalized videos before making loan decision(s).
Small businesses come to Investable for funding and exposure. Lenders follow.</p>
